      <p>I am a passionate problem solver. Self starter and team player that wants to bring the best out of everyone and myself. Tackling simple and complex issues brings me fulfillment. I love learning plain and simple.</p><br></br>

<p>I am a software engineer that always looks at the big picture and imagines what is possible. Seeing ideas through and creating with others is the best feeling. I want to meaningfully contribute to a team and give my best.</p><br></br>

<p>I am a thoughtful person that lives to make others happy and keep the vibes up. Willing to go the extra mile and then some. As a call center coordinator I am required to ensure quality and implement solutions to ever-changing issues whether it be customer or operation related.

When I have free time you&amps;ll find me with my family. They are the best.
